# Customer Behaviour Analysis (End-to-End Data Analytics Project)

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a **corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow**, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into **strategic business intelligence** by:

✅ **Data Preparation, Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python):** Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.  
✅ **Data Analysis (SQL):** Simulate business transactions and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.  
✅ **Visualization & Insights (Power BI):** Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.  
✅ **Report and Presentation:** Write a clear project report summarizing key findings and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

This notebook includes:

Data Import

Data Exploration (EDA)

Data Cleaning

Connection to SQL Database

Loading cleaned data into SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server)

3) Load the cleaned data into SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MS SQL Server)

Create a database in your SQL tool

Run the notebook cells that:

connect to the DB

create tables (if included)

load the cleaned dataset into SQL tables

4) Run SQL business queries

Open: customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql
Use the queries to answer business questions such as:

Which categories/items contribute the most revenue?

Which segments show higher loyalty / repeat purchases?

How do discount/promo usage influence purchase behaviour?

What are the common payment and shipping preferences?

5) Connect SQL Database to Power BI

Open: customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix

Update your server + database credentials

Refresh the data model

Explore insights using slicers and filters

6) Create the project report and presentation

Write a report summarising:

key findings

charts + KPIs

business recommendations

Build a presentation deck using Gamma AI to communicate insights to stakeholders
